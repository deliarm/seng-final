Final project for Group 2 SENG 513: UCapital - An all in one stock and crypto application

How to run the application:
Firstly, node.js is needed so download it from  https://nodejs.org/en/. Then open a terminal run "npm install" inside the ucapital folder (C:/seng-final/ucapital) of the project. After that, run "npm start" in the upcapital folder. This will open the login page on your browser. Next we need to run the servers for the login page and the chat application which will be in the home page. To do this, open another 2 terminals. In one of the terminals, go to the ucapital/login-backend folder (C:/seng-final/ucapital/login-backend) and run "npm install" and then "npm start." This will run the server for the login page. in the other terminal, go to the ucapital/src/components/chatApp/server folder (C:/seng-final/ucapital/src/components/chatApp/server) and run "npm install" and then "npm start. This will run tthe server for the chat application. From here you can make an account and log in to enter the website.
